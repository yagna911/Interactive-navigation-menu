In this code:  index.html defines the structure of the Notepad with a &lt;textarea> element for text input and "Save" and "Load" buttons. styles.css provides basic styling for the Notepad. script.js adds functionality to save and load text from local storage.
The code provided in my previous response is for a simple web-based text editor that you can run in a web browser. To generate and see the output of this code, follow these steps:

Create a new directory (folder) on your computer to organize your project files.

Inside this directory, create three files with the following names and extensions:

index.html
styles.css
script.js
Copy the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code provided in my previous response into their respective files:

Copy the HTML code into index.html.
Copy the CSS code into styles.css.
Copy the JavaScript code into script.js.
Save all three files in the same directory.

Open the index.html file using a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari). You can do this by right-clicking the index.html file and selecting "Open with" or by simply double-clicking the file.

This will open the web-based Notepad in your browser. You'll see a textarea where you can type or paste text. There are "Save" and "Load" buttons below the textarea.

You can type or paste text into the textarea, click the "Save" button to save the content to your browser's local storage, and click the "Load" button to retrieve and display the saved content in the textarea.

The output will be a simple text editor interface with the ability to save and load text content. You can type or edit text, save it, and load it as needed.
